# Corey LePine and William Watkins' ASEN 5044 Final Project
## An Orbit Determination Project
This was a project for ASEN 5044: Statistical Estimation for Dynamical Systems.  We chose to work on the orbit determination problem given under *Assignments*.  The project began with determining the correct system of equations that described the nonlinearized system, then linearizing that system and simulating it.
The second half of the project involved the implementation of various types of Kalman Filters to simulate the behavior of the spacecraft using Monte Carlo simulations.  These Kalman Filters were then compared to the actual data for the spacecraft to determine how well they estimated the orbits.
High level limerick writing was also required.

The results of this project can be found under *Report*.
